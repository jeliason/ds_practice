### This repository contains all of my ongoing projects. Projects that I am actively working on are
* the __clinvar__ project, in which I am classifying conflicting genetic variants. I show my process for EDA, data cleaning/preprocessing, first pass at modeling and feature engineering and selection. I find that downsampling the data greatly increases the support for conflicting cases.

### Projects that are not currently active are
* the __diabetes__ project, in which I predict hospital readmissions rates from diabetes data. I show my process for EDA, data cleaning/preprocessing (using pandas), first pass at modeling (using scikit-learn), feature engineering and selection (using featuretools) and continued modeling and model interpretability (using permutation importance and SHAP values). Feature engineering yields an improved F-score on RF classifier from 0.58 to 0.69.
* __hw_pyspark__, in which I use PySpark and Spark MLLib to model a dataset that has heavy class imbalance
* __har__, in which I use PCA/LDA for feature selection and then a logistic model in order to predict human activity from a cellphone accelerometer and gyroscope
* __neuro__, in which I carry out EDA on neural population spiking data, as well as discuss potential avenues for future statistical modeling of population data
* __flights__, in which I perform EDA on flight delay data
* __passync_schools__, in which I dissect school success in NYC on several axes
