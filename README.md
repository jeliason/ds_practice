### This repository contains all of my ongoing projects. Projects that I am actively working on are
* the __clinvar__ project, in which I am classifying conflicting genetic variants
* the __diabetes__ project, in which I am predicting hospital readmissions rates from diabetes data
* the __neuro__ project, in which I am attempting to formulate relevant features for prediction of stimulus from neural spike data (an especially interesting project considering that n~100 and the dimensionality of this space is huge. See e.g. [this paper](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/be337f_cd1a90239ac94fa1a35cd9bf4cd35502.pdf) describing how the characterization of neural population statistics is an extremely challenging problem).
