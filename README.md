### This repository contains all of my ongoing projects. Projects that I am actively working on are
* the __diabetes__ project, in which I am trying to predict hospital readmissions rates from diabetes data
* the __neuro__ project, in which I am attempting to formulate relevant features for prediction of stimulus from neural spike data (an especially interesting project considering that n~100).
